### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/iMPERIAL18/create-custom-circuit-with-zksnark.git`
2. Change to the project directory: `cd create-custom-circuit-with-zksnark`
3. Install the required dependencies: `npm i`

### Executing Program

Follow the steps below to execute the custom circuit creation:

1. Generate a custom circuit using Circom by running: `npx hardhat circom`
2. Deploy the circuit to the Mumbai network using the command: `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network mumbai`
